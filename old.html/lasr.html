<h1>Lasr</h1>
<h3><a href=http://lars.nocrew.org>lars</a>' adaptive stochastic raytracer</h3>

I think this is a simple (so far, but beware of feeping creaturism), yet
very powerful (in terms of realism) piece of software.
<p>

Please note that this document is somewhat optimistic and preliminary.
Not all features are actually implemented yet, and should be moved into
a TODO section.
<p>

Features:

<ul>
<li>It's lars', i.e. mine.  But don't worry, it's
    <a href=http://www.gnu.org>GPL</a>'ed, so it's free to use,
    share, and modify.
<li>Adaptive.  It tries to recognize complex areas of the image and
    render these using more rays to achieve better results.
<li>Stochastic.  It usually samples every pixel many times, and randomly
    distributes the rays over the pixel (supersampling), camera lens (depth
    of field), time (motion blur), diffuse light reflection (penumbras,
    ambient light), specular reflection (blurred mirrors), refractive
    transmission (blurred glass), wavelength (rainbows), and more.  Hmm, all
    of this isn't implemented yet.
<li>Humanity.  There are no privileged light sources.  All objects are
    equals.  Some just happen to emit light, and others just reflect/transmit
    it.
<li>Brute force method and slowness.  I have tried optimizing the structure
    of the code as well as hot spots in the program, but still, since it
    ends up tracing many many rays per pixel, it is slower than most other
    rendering software.
<li>Simplicity.  One advantage of using this method is that the program
    is quite small and simple.
<li>Distributed computing.  I think ray tracing lends itself very
    naturally to distributed computing, so will write a server and a
    client.  I'll try to have Lasr running on as many machines
    on the internet as possible.
<li>Quick and efficient bug fixing.  You find the bug - you fix it.
    Joking aside, since Lasr is just a hobby project, I
    can't guarantee support.
<li>Linux support.  Actually, Linux is my development platform.
<li>Vapourware.  It's not available yet.
</ul>

Sources of inspiration:

<ul>
<li>The article Stochastic Sampling and Distributed Ray Tracing by
    Robert L Cook - for the idea of stochastically distributing rays.
<li><a href=http://www.povray.org>POV-Ray</a> - for making me realize
    that a crippled definition language is the Wrong Thing.
<li><a href=http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance>Radiance</a> - for showing
    that these kinds of things are possible.
