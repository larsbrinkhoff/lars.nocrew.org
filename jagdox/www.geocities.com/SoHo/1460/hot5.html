<TD><B>Van Halen, 1984 </B>
<P>The worlds best guitarist playing the best guitar moments in rock's
history.One highlight after the other until the last two songs. Which would
have fit better on one of the earlier four records (which are all great
also).</P>

<TD><B>Ministry, Psalm 69 </B>
<P>This record set the standards for heavy riffing in the nineties. A standard
that hasn't been surpassed although many have tried. But perfection can
at best be matched. Just one fix,just one fix</P>

<TD><B>Prodigy, Music for the Jilted Generation </B>
<P>Its very rare nowadays to buy a record with more than two outstanding
songs on it. This record is almost completely full of them. Energetic,
innovative, highly danceable. Music can't do any better than this.</P>

<TD>J<B>oe Satriani, Surfing with the Alien </B>
<P>Incredible soloing on top of very good songs indeed. I read in a guitar
magazine article once, that Satriani had to stop playing this aggressive
style, because he clenched his teeth so tightly during play, that he got
a serious health disorder. On the solos in &quot;Surfing&quot; and &quot;Ice
9&quot; , you know when its teeth-clenching time. Best solos in record
history.</P>

<TD><B>Front 242, Front by Front</B> 
<P>The beat masters from belgium. This is the only great record Front 242
ever made, a landmark in electronic music. Polyrhytmic electronic mayhem
with skinhead imagery and brutal vocal delivery. It's that good, that there
isn't even a distant second in EBM territory in sight.</P>
