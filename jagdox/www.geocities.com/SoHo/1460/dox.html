This is an attempt to document the internals of the Jaguar, Ataris
highly successful &lt;grin&gt; 64 bit videogame console. This documentation
is created independent of Atari and provided to you for educational
purposes only.<BR>
What you're seeing is a work in progress, that will probably never be
completed, but all the basic information needed to program the beast is
there or so we feel. There aren't as far as we can see many white areas left,
and one should be able to write software on the Jaguar now w/o the need
for other documentation.<BR>
The documentation is still very much in need of clarification and debugging,
and you're very much welcome to join in the effort. If you find
anything that is missing or described incorrectly, please
by all means let us know. If you prefer to remain anoymous, that's OK.
<P>
Updated versions of these documents are spread exclusively via  
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/1460">Nat's Legasthenic Legacy</A>.
The documentation isn't fully HTMLized yet (and probably never will be). 
Although the dox still are preformatted ASCIIsh looking, they are HTML
texts, that don't look all that good in raw format in an editor (any more).
For ASCII readers only, the documentation ZIP set now contains a UNIX
shell script, to convert some HTML code into readable text.
<P>
<I>We can not emphasize enough that these docs still contain <U>a few</U> 
inaccuracies.
We are still finding bugs, because we made stupid assumptions and/or 
didn't test carefully enough. 
If something isn't working as expected try an experiment on your own.
And then tell us about it!</I>
<P>
Nevertheless we hope that these files will prove to be helpful in
your explorations. Good luck.

This is work is not yet complete and we need your help. So we
