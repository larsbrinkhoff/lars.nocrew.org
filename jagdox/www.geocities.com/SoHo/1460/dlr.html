     DAVID LEE ROTH   ---  The man, the philosopher, the QUOTES!!   v2.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Listen to recorded interviews, read old magazines, view taped shows. 
Extract the quotes and send 'em in!! 
Corrections/additions are certainly welcome. 

Send your contributions to: <address><a href="mailto:nat@zumdick.rhein-main.de">nat@zumdick.rhein-main.de</A></address>

This file is just the starting point for a hopefully 'complete'
collection of quotes or possibly short anecdotes. Of course neither
I nor the contributors can make any claims (or maybe they can and I 
am just ignoring them (har har)) about the accurateness of any of 
the quotes. So far I haven't done any editing. At later times I might 
make a distinction between 'good' and 'lame' quotes.
There is a new entry here called NONQUOTES, which contains indirect
speach.

If a source or a comment was given by the contributor it has been left
intact (or just slightly cut).

Read "From:" as "Contributed by:" also you never can be sure... (har har).

GENERAL PHILOSOPHY:


From: Thom B.
        
        "With a little budget and some creativity, you can sell a 
        toothbrush to a camel. With a bigger budget and some more 
        creativity, you can sell him two toothbrushes. With an even bigger 
        budget and a *lot* of creativity, you can not only sell him a dozen 
        toothbrushes, but he will walk away wondering how he ever got along 
        without them... and he'll jump on the mailing list."  
                - quoted from memory


From: Nat!

      Dreams:
        "Trouble with dreams is, a lot of them do come true. By the time 
        they do, you've turned into somebody else. That's what happens with 
        time... It's always been important to me, that my dream come true, 
        when I wanted. We turned our dream into reality by not even really 
        pursueing either one. We didn't pursue the dream and we certainly 
        didn't pursue reality!"
                - [2]

      Imitators:  &lt;The red short theory&gt;
        "If you imagine a hundred people running down the street in a road 
        race and one of 'em is in front; ninetynine are in back. Ninetynine 
        in back go: 'How come Ray is in front of the pack all the time ?' 
        He is wearing red shorts...
        Cut to the next race: You see ninetynine people in red shorts.
        Ray is still in front. They go... 'It must be... the shoes!'"
                - [1] speaking about VH copying groups

      Inhibitions:
        "Inhibitions are like vices. And you work your way thru them. We 
        worked our way thru all the possible vices that one could get 
        involved in, as the band started. There are hundreds of them and 
        they were all detrimental to us. And now I have the four or five 
        that I like the best and I just do those all the time. As you work 
        your way thru these vices, you lose your inhibitions."
                - [2]

      Life:
        "There's a spark, some kind of energy. Energy is what it's all 
        about. When you celebrate something, you're making energy. When you 
        have a thought, your making energy. When you make love, your having 
        energy. When you give birth, it's energy. And the sad things in 
        life are loss of energy. Somebody dies, something dies, lack of it, 
        no energy. Something stops, your car grinds to a halt, and you 
        gotta just leave it there by the side of the Santa Monica Freeway, 
        it's loss of energy. And it takes different buttons to hit that 
        spark in each person. And some people need a hockey game, and some 
        people need a political rally, and the rest of us need Van Halen!"
                - [2]

      Life II:
        "Life is not a popularity contest. Do not expect to see Valentino 
        in the mirror."
                - [2]

      MTV:
        "When you get something like MTV, it's like regular television. You 
        get it, and at first it's novel and brand new and then you watch 
        every channel, every show. And then you become a little more 
        selective and more selective, until ultimately...  
        You wind up with a radio."
                - [3]

      New Years Resolution:
        "Doggie dog world that it is, I think now it's a good time on 
        New Years, to decide whether you're gonna be a hot dog or a little 
        weeny. And I have chosen to remain a little wiener for one more 
        season."
                - [3]

      Rock'n'Roll I:
        "Somebody asks me, `Dave, what;s it mean when you say somebody's
        rocking or somebody's not rocking' I say, `I'll illustrate: a guy 
        with black socks, black shoes, blue and white bermuda shorts, 
        hawaiian luau shirt, a Nikon and a jackknife around his neck, zinc 
        oxide on his nose, a pair of sunglasses, a fishing hat with all the 
        badges on it, and he's staring up the tall buildings - that's 
        rock & roll.' Now, the freedom to do that is very serious, but the 
        picture is a crackup."
                - [5]


From: Mr. Scary (Gary Chapman)

      Rock'n'Roll II:
        "There's a little Van Halen in all of us, and we're just trying to 
        bring it out. It's like something bursts inside of you, something 
        that makes you not care what people around you are thinking. It 
        makes you invincible, like if a car hit you, nothing would happen 
        to you. It should make you feel like the Charge of the Light 
        Brigade, even if you're just going to the bathroom. When you do 
        that on a mass level, it becomes hysterical, not political. It 
        expands to a large group of people not caring about conventions, 
        just getting in the thrill of being themselves. That experience is 
        about the audience, not us. All we do is provide the soundtrack. 
        Van Halen's got nothing to hide. What you've walked into is a 
        self-created fantasyland where everything happens four times as 
        quick. Anything you desire you can find here, whatever your vice. 
        Whatever, somebody else can't do in his 9-5 job, I can do in 
        rock'n'roll."
                - [4]

      Rock'n'Roll III:
        "You want to know if we're animals ? When I'm on stage with the 
        volume rippling my body like a glass of water and thousands of 
        people are generating heat in my direction, there's no time for 
        thought. My basement facilities take over completely. Sure it's 
        animal. 
        People might like to talk about art, but look where art is, in the 
        gutter. Van Halen likes to keep things simple. All we're doing is 
        giving our daily lives melodies, beats and titles. What we sing 
        about is what we live. It's the glamour, the tinsel, the non-stop, 
        late-night, endless party that is the crest of the biggest wave 
        with spray in your face. It's the laugh in the face of death blown 
        out of proportion, mutated reality that is the wonderful, wacky, 
        crazy, cutup, cutey worlds of rock'n'roll."
                - [4]

      Rock'n'Roll V:
        "What are the characteristics of a good rock'n'roller ? Rock'n'roll 
        is in you. You either got it or you don't. You can't fake it. It 
        has to be inside you just itching to get out. And when it does, 
        POW! It's like a dam bursting. That's Van Halen."
                - [4]



LIVE SHOW ANECDOTES/QUOTES:

        "The girls in Sweden are fantastic. Last night when I went to bed
        in my hotel room, there was this girl banging on my hotel room 
        door. She screamed and begged me to open the door. I shouted to 
        her, that she should stop, but she continued. In the end I had to 
        get up and let her out"
