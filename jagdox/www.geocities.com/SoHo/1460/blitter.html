<A NAME="Blitter"></A>
The BLiTTER
-----------

The Blitter is a little different to what you're used to
on your ST (and you probably didn't get used to it very much
anyway).

You can blit a scaled pixmap to an unscaled destination
or you can blit an unscaled pixmap unto a scaled destination. Or you can
rotate the source and the destination bitmap, and in some cases you
can scale and rotate at the same time (I think scaling up and rotating
without leaving holes isn't possible)

The former will probably be the most often used. The source or the
destination can be arbitrarily 'angled' lines and need not be
contiguous addresses. Furthermore you can blit pixels of 1 bit, 2 bit
4 bit 8 bit 16 bit or 32bit depth.

The Blitter in broad outline works like this:

The blitter has two channels called A1 and A2, where it reads from and 
writes data to. 
A1 is the sophisticated channel allowing fractional pixel treatment
(like f.e. read pixel 1 twice, then pixel2 twice etc. for an effective
scaling of 2.0), whereas A2 is a simple channel allowing only integer
increments of the addresses. This means that A2 can only be used for
straight or diagonal lines.

Picture in your mind that a channel is pointing to a square bitmap. 
You define the width of this bitmap and the origin at which the blitter 
should start fetching data. The origin might for example be the center 
of your bitmap, or the upper left corner, you decide!.
You then define the orientation (slope) of the line the blitter should
'draw' into (or 'fetch' from) this bitmap.

            .....width.......
channel --> +----------------+
            |                |
            |  x  (origin)   | 
            |   \            |
            |    \  (slope)  |
            |                |
            +----------------+


In a real life environment you might for example use A2 as the source
of your texture, that is stored as a contiguous block in memory and
A1 is used to draw an arbitrary scaled and angled line of your polygon.
Or you might use A1 to traverse the texture data at an arbitrary angle
and update the destination pixmap in a scan-line fashion horizontally
left to right.

If you want to scale the bitmap you gotta figure out whether you want
to shrink or to enlarge. If you want to enlarge, you need to use A1
as the source and A2 as the destination, using fractional incrementing
on the source, if you want to shrink you want to use A1 as the destination
(also with fractional increments)


You can do a few operations concurrently while blitting your data.

If you're drawing with a single color and outputting cry-color pixels 
you can gouraudshade them at the same time at no extra cost. The 
blitter will use the intensity of the pixel and add the contents of a 
register to it (saturating add). This will work nicely for single lines,
but not for regions, where the blitter does not reinitalize the intensity 
for the starting pixel. (Your job)
The contents of this register are then updated for the next pixel.
Since the update is fractional, you can achieve a smooth shaded
line with this.

You can add an intensity factor to your incoming cry-color data.

<A NAME="z-buffer"></A>
You can also use the Z-buffering capabilities of the blitter. 
Your destination data is not just an array of pixel values, but rather a 
combination of Z-data and pixel data. Consider the Z-data to be the 
third coordinate providing depth. 
The smaller the value, the nearer it is to the viewer. (usual convention)
You set up the blitter with a starting Z-value for your line and a factor 
that should be added for every pixel step, thereby possibly increasing 
or decreasing the Z-position. 

That value is then compared to the Z-data of the destination pixel. 
If the z-value (in the registers) is less than the the destination value, 
the pixel will be written - else the pixel will not be written. The 
destination pixel is then updated with the new Z-buffer value. 

A Z-data is the same size as the pixel, and a pixel is always 16 bit sooo...
The layout will be typically something like this:

     phrase #0   phrase #1   phrase #2   phrase #3
   +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
    P0 P1 P2 P3 Z0 Z1 Z2 Z3 P4 P5 P6 P7 Z4 Z5 Z6 Z7

The you'd specify a phrase offset of 1 for the Z-data and use a "pitch"
of 2 for accessing the pixel phrases (in the Blitter's A?_FLAGS registers).


You can probably do collision detection on background colors, and
transparent blits...


<A NAME="modes"></A>
Phrasemode and Pixelmode. 
------------------------

The blitter can operate either in pixelmode or in phrasemode. Phrasemode
is (in 16-bit cry-color) usually four times faster and is therefore much more
desirable. But there are some limitations that are connected to phrasemode:

o  Both A1 and A2 must work in phrasemode, you can't have one running in
   pixelmode and the other in phrasemode

o  Phrasemode implies linear address (or horizontally oriented) blits
   It looks like phrasemode doesn't work with all resolutions. So
   far only 16bit modes are known to work.

Scales and rotates aren't possible in phrasemode.
[ Please note, that you can do (non rotated) sprite scaling also with an OP
object, which might (or not) be more convenient ]

For blitter actions that <A HREF="general.html#RAM">span across a page</A> you
currently gotta figure, that the machine takes

   time = 1 write + [4 cycles read source] + [1 cycle read destination]
 
   (This is mathematically correct doesn't really reflect the reality 
   though, because source reads outside the page also force a slower 
   destination write)
  
regardless of pixelmode or phrasemode. If you keep the accesses to within
a page you should calculate it as:

   time = 1 write + [1 cycles read source] + [1 cycle read destination]

Of course in phrasemode you usually speed up the blitting process in 
16 bit pixel mode by a factor of four. 
(Cycles meaning bus cycles (i.e. 2 system cycles))

This means, that the Blitter should be capable of doing about 
(with the video system running a 256x200 cry-color screen):

   Gouraud pixelmode  : 13.3 / 1 = 13.3 Mio pixels / second
                              or ca. 222000 pixels / frame
   Copyblit pixelmode : 13.3 / 5 =  2.7 Mio pixels / second 
                               or ca. 44000 pixels / frame
   XOR blit pixelmode : 13.3 / 6 =  2.2 Mio pixels / second
                               or ca. 37000 pixels / frame

and in phrasemode (16 bit pixels)

   Gouraud phrasemode : 13.3 * 4 / 1 = 53.2 Mio pixels / second
                                  or ca. 887000 pixels / frame
   Copyblit pixelmode : 13.3 * 4 / 5 =  2.7 Mio pixels / second 
                                  or ca. 177000 pixels / frame
   XOR blit pixelmode : 13.3 * 4 / 6 =  2.2 Mio pixels / second
                                  or ca. 148000 pixels / frame

<! gotta redo this bit for better understandability.>
<! who's doing destination reads and when...>
 

<A NAME="RMW"></A>
READ-MODIFY-WRITE
-----------------

It's important for the proper setup of the blitter, to know when the
blitter will need to do a RMW. A RMW occurs whenever the destination
is read, then modified by the blitter and then written back back. A
classic example of RMW is the exclusive or like *dst ^= 0xFFFF;

RMW does happen when you're using the blitter in pixelmode and the
bitmap depth is below 16 bit (8 bit?). 

RMW does also happen with _all_ logical blitting ops except:

         0: LFU_ZERO     DST = 0              (LFU_CLEAR)
         3: LFU_NOTS     DST = ! SRC
        12: LFU_S        DST = SRC           (LFU_REPLACE)
        15: LFU_ONE      DST = 1

Writing into the lower word activates the blitter! 

src:
        bit 0: SRCEN   source data read enable
        bit 1: SRCENZ  source Z-data read enable
        bit 2: SRCENX  source extra data read enable

   With this set of bits you tell the blitter what kind of
   data accesses it needs to perform. It can not figure it out from the
   way the other command bits are set and conclude what it needs to
   do, you have to instruct the blitter yourself. If you're doing
   straight copies from memory to memory, you will want to set bit0.
   If you're using the Z-buffer capabilities you'd want to set bit1
   as well.
   If your source data spans more phrases than the destination data
   then you need to set bit2 to tell the blitter to do that extra 
   phrase read.

dst:
        bit 3: DSTEN   destination data read enable
        bit 4: DSTENZ  destination Z-data read enable
        bit 5: DSTWRZ  destination Z write enable

   You'd want to set DSTEN if you're doing read-modify-write cycles on the 
   destination. (See RMW-Cycles below). Else you should clear this bit 
   (or pay the price in speed decrease).
   Likewise if you're not going to do Z-buffer blitting keep bits 4 and 5
   clear, else set'em!
   Note that you can not disable 'destination write' because, you'd just
   not use the Blitter in this case, right ?

misc:
        bit 6: CLIP_A1 enable A1 clipping
        bit 7:         unused

   You can clip the pixmap that is handled with the A1 register set.
   If this bit is set, then the information in the A1_CLIP register is
   used to clip the A1 lines. See A1_CLIP for more information about
   clipping.

   Actually it's a lie, that bit 7 is unused. It does something but
   nothing interesting so far.

A1-control (A1ctl):
        bit 8: UPDA1   enable A1 update step fraction part
        bit 9: UPDA1F  enable A1 update step integer part
        bit10: UPDA2   enable A2 update step

  You hint the Blitter here, which step registers it should update.
  If you're just doing line-drawings you don't need any of these bits
  set. Only when you're blitting in two dimensions you need to consider
  these bits. The idea behind them is probably not that you can
  improve the blitter performance but rather the setup performance,
  since you know which registers change and which not and need not
  update all of them for consecutive blits.

mode:
        bit11: DSTA2   use A2 as destination
        bit12: GOURD   enable Gouraud shading
        bit13: ZBUFF   enable Z-buffer handling (sometimes called GOURZ)

   Usually (DSTA2 cleared) you use A2 as the source and A1 as the
   destination. You can reverse the roles by setting this bit.
   Set bit12 (GOURD) to enable Gouraudshading. Gouraudshading will only
   be "gouraud shading" if used on cry-color data. Use the intensity
   counters/incrementers to specify the shading (see B_IINC for
   further reference)
   With ZBUFF you enable Z-buffer handling (look for the A1_FLAGS for
   a small description of Z-buffer handling).


intensity (ity) and other stuff:
        bit14: TOPBEN   carry into nybble
        bit15: TOPNEN   carry into byte
        bit16: PATDSEL  use pattern data (instead of source)

   TOPBEN and TOPNEN will all be explained in the gouraud shading description
   coming up soon. You can control with the bit TOPB/NEN where the overflow
   from the intensity addition should be stored (added to)
   On a completely different note, if you just want to initialize a
   memory region (or draw a line) in a single color, you don't need to
   read the source data from memory. You can let the blitter pull the
   color from one of its own registers (B_PATD). This saves you on
   the average a read cycle for every phrase written, which is a good
   thing. None of the logical blitter operations apply when using the 
   pattern data register. You can't XOR your bitmap with the pattern data!

z-op:
        bit18-20:

        bit18: ZMODELT  source < destination
        bit19: ZMODEEQ  source = destination
        bit20: ZMODEGT  source > destination

   or

        0:      unused
        1:      src < dst
        2:      src == dst
        3:      src <= dst
        4:      src > dst
        5:      src != dst
        6:      src >= dst
        7:      unused

   You can tell the blitter how to decide, whether the source data should
   overwrite the destination pixel or not when using the Z-buffer mode.
   Usually you will want to put a 3 or a 1 here, so that you're
   'nearer' pixels overwrite the 'farther' pixels. (Assuming that your
   Z-buffer values are the higher, the farther away from the viewer
   they are)

OP:     logical operation the Blitter should perform

        bit21: LFU_NAN  ! source & ! destination
        bit22: LFU_NA   ! source &   destination
        bit23: LFU_AN     source & ! destination
        bit24: LFU_A      source &   destination

   or

         0: LFU_ZERO     DST = 0              (LFU_CLEAR)
         1: LFU_NSAND    DST = ! SRC & ! DST
         2: LFU_NSAD     DST = ! SRC & DST
         3: LFU_NOTS     DST = ! SRC
         4: LFU_SAND     DST = SRC & ! DST
         5: LFU_NOTD     DST = ! DST
         6: LFU_N_SXORD  DST = ! (SRC ^ DST)
         7: LFU_NSORND   DST = ! SRC | ! DST
         8: LFU_SAD      DST = SRC & DST
         9: LFU_SXORD    DST = SRC ^ DST     (LFU_XOR)
        10: LFU_D        DST = DST
        11: LFU_NSORD    DST = ! SRC | DST
        12: LFU_S        DST = SRC           (LFU_REPLACE)
        13: LFU_SORND    DST = SRC | ! DST
        14: LFU_SORD     DST = SRC | DST
        15: LFU_ONE      DST = 1

   Just as on the Atari ST blitter you can have the usual set of
   logical operations you can perform on your data. Use 12 for your
   copying blits and 0 for your single color initilization. Note that
   if you set bit16 (use pattern data), then the blitter will NOT
   zero your buffer with OP==0, but fill it with the pattern color
   instead.
   The opcodes are ignored when bit16 is set.

control:
      bit25: CMPDST   compare destination pixel with pattern pixel
      bit26: BCOMPEN  bit compare, write inhibit
      bit27: DCOMPEN  data compare, write inhibit
      bit28: BKGWREN  write inhibit, still write
      bit29: BUSHI    hog the bus
      bit30: SRCSHADE source shading

   bit25 (CMPDST):   If you enable this the destination pixel (that 
                     will be overwritten) is compared with the value 
   stored in the pattern-data register (B_PATD). 
   If you enable this in conjunction with B_STOP this _maybe_ is used as 
   a way to do hardware collision detection. (like in GTIA on the Atari
   8 bit). Supposedly works only in 8 and 16 bit modes.

   bit26 (BCOMPEN):   speculation: The lower 8 bit of the source value 
                      are examined. If all bits are 0 then nothing will 
   be written back, if all of them are set then everything will be written 
   back. Now what happens if there are just a few bits set ? 
   Imagine that the pixels of the destination pixmap are numbered from
   7 to 0 wrapping at -1 back to 8. 
      
     Start of line blit
        \                    
         7654321076543210765
               ^
               current pixel position     

     Source pixel value:   0xFF55  ->  11111111 01010101

         76543210
         01010101
               ^
   
     So this pixel value will not be written.
   
   Don't ask me what that might be good for. See DCOMPEN for more details
   about collision detection. Supposedly works only in 8 and 16 bit modes.

   
   bit27 (DCOMPEN):  used most often in conjunction with bit25. 
                     If you set bit25 and bit27 the effect will be that 
   only those destination values will be overwritten that do not match 
   the value stored in B_PATD. (If bit 25 is off, then the comparison will
   be made with the source pixel)
   So if you put the color 0x0000 into B_PATD only those pixels will be 
   written, where there are not zero-valued pixels in the destination bitmap. 
   You should have DSTEN on!
   The write inhibit serves a second function in collision detection. If 
   bit #2 is set in the B_STOP register, then the blitter will stop when
   such a inhibit would occur. Look at B_STOP for more details.
   If you have BKGWREN set, then the data will be written back still.
   Supposedly works only in 8 and 16 bit modes.

   bit28 (BKGWREN):  when a write inhibit occurs, this flag enables the 
                     blitter to still perform the write, but to write 
   back destination data. This only applies to pixel mode, in phrase 
   mode destination data is always written. 

   bit29 (BUSHI):    seems to let the blitter hog the bus completely. 
                     This is not such a good idea for extensive blits, 
   since apparently the OP is also shut off and you'll see garbage on the 
   screen. For small blits this might yield an overall system performance 
   increase, when you're pushing the machine to its limits.

   bit30 (SRCSHADE): Enable source shading. Yes it does work, although 
                     the setup is a bit weird because you seem to have to 
   set bit3 (destination read enable) for real source shading to happen. 
   Put the shade value into B_IINC. Looks really cool.
   You can get some funky albeit as yet unpredictable (?) effects putting
   a value in B_DSTD and disabling the destination read. F.e. put the 
   B_IINC to $40000 and blit repeatedly incrementing B_DSTD (and delaying
   a little between blits). It's psychedelic!
   Alternatively, if you've ZBUFF on, you don't have to enable DSTEN.

  intensity.f:          delta for gouraud shading, fractional part
  
   This register is used for chroma changes and gouraud shading (or 
   both operations together). Chroma changes are like gouraud shades,
   but with an intensity delta of zero. Pure gouraud shadings have a chroma
   delta value of zero.
   This register is added to either B_PATD in pixelmode or B_I0 to B_I3 in 
   phrasemode. The intensity is saturation added, meaning that you can't 
   have an intensity wrap around. The chroma change on the other hand does
   wrap around. The integer part is by the way sign extended.
   So normally chroma and intensity are two separate entities that don't 
   influence each other. If you want you can set in the B_CMD register
   either TOPBEN or TOPNEN. 
   If you set TOPNEN then the carry of the saturation add will be added to
   the upper nybble (chroma.i) of the current source data value.
   If you set TOPBEN then there will be _no_ saturation for the addition 
   of the intensity delta. Instead the carry is added to the top byte of 
   the current source data value. If you set both, you'll achieve the
   effect of TOPBEN but _with_ saturation. 
  
   B_I0, B_I1, B_I2, B_I3 are used in phrasemode instead of B_IINC, 
   which is used in pixelmode.

pixelvalue:
  
   If you're doing RMW-cycles with the blitter and have not enabled data
   reads, then this register will be used as input for the logical operations
   instead.
  
   Depending on the blitter-mode (pixelmode or phrasemode) there is either
   only one pixel kept in here (phrase 0) right-side aligned by the way,
   or as many pixels that can fit in a phrase.
  
   Experiments show that the value in DSTD is NOTed before being used as
   a logical operation. Curious.
  
   f.e.
      move.l   #(1<<16)|WIDTH,B_COUNT
      move.l   #PITCH1|PIXEL16|WID320|XADDPIX,A1_FLAGS
      move.l   #PITCH1|PIXEL16|WID320|XADDPIX,A2_FLAGS
      move.l   #$00000FFFF,B_DSTD
      move.l   #SRCEN|LFU_XOR,d0

   is actually a straight replacement, although one would expect

   stop: 
      bit 0:   Resume
      bit 1:   Abort
      bit 2:   Collision detection

   Uses 3 bits to resume or stop after a write inhibit occurs. Inhibit 
   will occur when painting pixel-pixel mode, Xadd=1, BKGWREN=0, and one 
   of the BCOMPEN, DCOMPEN or Zmodem0-2 are set, with matching conditions.

   Resume:  Writing a one to this bit when the blitter has stopped
            will cause the blitter to resume operations. 
   Abort:   Writing a one to this bit when the blitter has stopped
            will cause the blitter to terminate the current operation 
            and return to its idle state. 
   Coll.:   Set this bit to enable blitter collision stops. This should
            stop the blitter. Then you can decide, whether to keep going
            or whether to abort the blit, using the first two bits.

z-offset (z-off):

      bit6-bit8 gives the number of phrases the Z-data is offset from
      your pixel phrase. 
      Apparently 0 and 7 are unusable values

width:
   bit9-14:

      This is the width in pixels of a scanline of the area pointed
      to by A1. Or in different words A1 points to a rectangular
      block of pixels. The pixels are organized in horizontal strips.
      You give the width of such a strip with this value.

      The number is not an integer value but rather a floating point
      value (no kidding). It is made up like this:

      1.[bit14-13] * 2^[bit12-9] so for example

      01 0101   would be 1.25 * 2^5 = 40     or
      10 1000   would be 1.5  * 2^8 = 384

         (1.00bin -> 1.00dec  1.01bin -> 1.25dec  
          1.10bin -> 1.5dec   1.11bin -> 1.75dec)

                  or you can think of it as:
      
      x   = 1 << [bit12-9] 
      res = x + (bit14 ? (x >> 1) : 0) + (bit15 ? (x >> 2) : 0);
      
      01 0101   would be 
         x   = 1 << 5                              /* 32 */
         res = 32 + (0 ? 16 : 0) + (1 ? 8 : 0);    /* 40 */

                             when using "add pixelsize" mode

   If you don't set any of these bits (0) then you are using the blitter
   in phrase mode. That means that pixels are grabbed in lots of phrases
   updated concurrently (one step) and written back in lots of phrases.
   (lots as in "quantity-size", not as "many"). Obviously you can use the
   phrasemode only for horizontal line blitting operations. Else you
   need to put the Blitter in pixel mode (in CrY Mode ~4x slower).


   Yadd control
   bit18: YADD0/YADD1        add zero (clear) or one (set) to Y
   bit20: YSIGNADD/YSIGNSUB  add 1/sub1 to Y (when bit18 is set)

<A NAME="BUGS"></A>
BUGS:
-----

It seems that when the blitter is done with blitting it is so happy that
it's done, it forgets to update the PIXEL registers with the STEP 
registers (UPDA1 UPDA2 UPDA1F).

Therefore this:

   move.l   #$00400040,B_COUNT
   move.l   #VALUE,B_CMD

        is not equivalent to this

   moveq    #$3F,d1
.loop:
   move.l   #$00010040,B_COUNT
   move.l   #VALUE,B_CMD
.wait:
   move.l   B_CMD,d0
   ror.w    #1,d0
   bcc.b    .wait
 
   dbra     d1,.loop
  


Clipping seems to be buggy, occasionally clipping too early. (??)

Rumor has it that you shouldn't start the blitter while the 68k is in 
interrupt processing. This is reported, although it sounds like bullshit.


<A NAME="DISCUSS"></A>
DISCUSSION:
----------

The designers of the Jaguar thought a lot about what makes a good
blitter and not. Important for a good blitter is that the setup time
is minimal. One of the reasons the Atari ST Blitter wasn't that successful
was that in the time needed to setup the chip - and you did have to 
setup and calculate quite a lot of values - you were typically just 
about done doing the blit in software (a small exaggeration).

The Jaguar blitter needs minimal setting up, because the hardware does a
lot of the calculations for you. For doing a memory clear f.e. you need to
write only five registers:

   A1_BASE
   A1_PIXEL
   A1_FLAGS
   A1_CMD
   B_PATD


With a little imagination you will find a lot of uses for this nice
piece of hardware, that go way outside of just drawing and filling.


The way the Jaguar's memory is accessed (in pages) make the Blitter
unfortunately not necessarily the speediest method for some operations,
since especially a blit is very often a nonlocal operation. 
(REF :<A HREF="coding.html#bitmaps">How to organize your bitmaps</A>)

Usually you want to copy a smaller bitmap (sprite) from some part of 
memory to another bigger bitmap (screen), which will most probably 
lie outside of the page, the source bitmap resides in.

This might mean (academically waxing here) that the blitter is an 
outdated concept as long as RAM is as slow as it is. To salvage the 
blitter concept it would seem promising to use a buffer to copy in a 
first pass all source data of a line into it. Then rerun the loop and 
use only destination (reads and) writes in conjunction with the now cached 
source data. This should approximate the maximum memory thruput.

It'd be probably just as well to provide the programmer with a
third fully busconnected GPU with a stripped down instruction set
to emulate a blitter himself.
