<H1>Changes to this documentation set</H1>
<HR>
The version of the documentation will be simply the versionnumber
of this file. So there can be jumps in the versionnumber, but who
cares :)
<P>
So the current version is $Revision: 1.30 $. The starting version,
will be affectionately known as the root version.

<UL>
<LI>Changed link for Jaguar Server page
<LI>Bastian Schick opened my eyes to a big error in my thinking
    concerning the calculation of OP-List cycles. I totally forgot
    to include the write cycles of the bitmap objects.
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Various bugfixes in instructions (Thanks to David A. Dahl)
<LI>Cleared up link problems with LinkBot

    wrong. (Thanks to David A. Dahl for pointing out the errors)
<LI>Typo fixed in cartridge.html
<LI>Removed "timings" from the 68k.html, which I never was very happy
    about and which probably confuses more than it enlightens.
<LI>Chapter 3.7 was accidently hidden by a faulty HTML code.
   (Thanks to David A. Dahl for stumbling over this)
<LI>Changed email address for Klaus :).

<UL>
<LI>Worked feedback from National Semiconductor (thanks J. Heitmeir)
    into the Cartridge dox.

</UL>

<HR>
<H3>Version 1.25</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Beautified the 68 doc

<LI>Added some Voodoo for the DSP IRQ routine
<LI>Small clarification for R_I2S register
<LI>Totally forgot to include the shift/rotation anchors into 
    the HMTL table in risc_doc.html. Since v1.13 and noone noticed!
