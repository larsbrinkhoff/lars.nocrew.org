 ATARI INTRODUCES FIRST COMPUTER SYSTEM DESIGNED FOR PERSONAL INTEGRATED
 MEDIA

 Atari Falcon030(tm) brings high-end capabilities to the market for less
 than $1,000.

 Boston (September 23, 1992)  Atari Corporation today announced the first
 available personal integrated media system, the Atari Falcon030
 computer.  From education to entertainment, personal integrated media
 (PIM) has the potential to change consumers' lives as dramatically as
 personal computers changed business offices.  The system will be
 available in November at authorized Atari Dealers across the country.

 A full scale computer based on the powerful 16 Mhz Motorola 68030
 microprocessor, the Atari Falcon030 is specifically designed for
 personal integrated media functions.  It gives even inexperienced users
 the ability to combine and manipulate video, audio, animation,
 telecommunications, text and graphics.  The system is optimized for
 these functions and incorporates technology usually reserved for high-
 end production systems.

 "The Atari Falcon030 is an ideal entry into the new and growing personal
 integrated media market," said Sam Tramiel, Atari's president and CEO.
 "It's a powerful system that gives users access to a whole new world of
 applications.  Yet the system remains easy-to-use and affordable."

 Consumers will be able to use the Atari Falcon030 as a color video
 phone, communicating in sound and pictures with other Atari Falcon030
 users.  The system makes it possible to create home videos complete with
 text and music, record lead vocals on a favorite rock 'n roll classic
 with the originals musicians playing along; narrate and score a family
 photo album, produce a visual family tree, invent and play an adventure
 game set in a childhood home; and much more.

 Atari Falcon030 users have immediate access to advanced PIM capabilities
 thanks to the following features:

 ||| Atari's Graphic Environment Manager (GEM) and built in graphics
     co-processor
 ||| A true color mode that includes more than 65,000 colors, twice the
     capability of the Apple MacIntosh LCII
 ||| The industry's only standard-equipped MIDI input/output ports
 ||| 16-bit stereo sound- input and output- for the highest quality
     reproductions available at sample rates up to 50 kHz
 ||| Built-in composite and RF video outputs for easy connection to video
     cassette recorders
 ||| External video sync for high quality genlocking
 ||| Overlay mode for easy video titling and special effects
 ||| Software for PIM applications such as desktop video productions,
     animations, music and entertainment.

 No other computer provides this level of performance and PIM
 capabilities at a more economical price.

 Applications Highlights

 PIM technology will make thousands of new capabilities possible.  There
 are already hundreds of software applications available for the Atari
 Falcon030, making it easy for users to accomplish a variety of new
 goals.

 Movie Quality Video

 With the Atari Falcon030, users can explore new avenues in home video,
 from inserting titles and credits to professional quality editing.  They
 can create music videos, cartoons, and school presentations.

 The Atari Falcon030 offers state of the art graphics, true color 16-bit
 mode allowing up to 640x480 resolution and a display of up to 65,536 on-
 screen colors.  It accepts external video synch for high quality
 genlocking, and uses a unique overlay mode for effortless titling and
 special effects.  In addition, users can obtain composite video signals
 directly from the Falcon030.

 High Quality Video

 Atari takes the music-industry standard -MIDI- one step further.  The
 only company to provide MIDI as a standard system component, the Atari
 Falcon030 also incorporates Motorola's 56001 digital signal processor
 (DSP) for the highest quality audio and special effects capabilities,
 allowing users to remove lead vocals and create their own Karoke machine
 or run music educations programs.

 The Atari Falcon030 provides users with features that are usually
 restricted to expensive, high-end machines.  But without any additional
 equipment, Atari Falcon030 users can record on two stereo tracks and add
 graphic equalization and special effects such as surround sound,
 harmonizing, reverberation, and echo.

 Pricing and Availability

 The Atari Falcon030 is a simple to use computer that doesn't require
 add-on boards or other costly optional hardware.  The Atari Falcon030
 already includes exactly what users need.  The machine offers a wealth
 of ports for communicating with existing peripherals, and application
 software for the Atari Falcon030 is readily available.

 Priced at $799 with 1 MB of RAM, the Atari Falcon030 is ideal for users
 who want a powerful, efficient, and cost-effective tool that can take
 advantage of today's technologies.  The system will be available in
 November through authorized Atari dealers.
