75.04: SPARC Xterminal 1, X Terminal Software Version 2.1
</H2>
<HR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Sun Microsystems Computer Company (SMCC) announces the SPARC(R)
Xterminal 1, an enhanced version of the SPARCclassic(TM) X X-terminal,
and X Terminal Software Version 2.1, the third release of software
supporting the SPARCstation X-terminal 1 hardware platform.
</P>

<P>
The SPARC Xterminal 1 features a new low-cost desktop package identical
to the SPARCstation(TM) 4, the addition of a new built-in 8-bit color pixel-
accelerating frame buffer, increased memory capacity to 8 MB standard
expandable to 128 MB, 1280 x 1024 resolution monitor support, and both
TurboGX(TM) and TurboGXplus(TM) acceleration configurations for up to
2.76 Xmarks of performance.  The SPARC X-terminal 1 remains the
industry's most innovative and is Sun's lowest priced network UNIX(R)
desktop system.
</P>

SPARC Xterminal 1
</H2>
<P>
Point-and-click administration tools with pop-up and
pull-down menues, speed centralized administration by grouping classes of
users. Superior networking through a 50-MHz microSPARC(TM) processor and a
selection from three levels of graphic performance enhance application
throughput.
</P>
<P>
The SPARC Xterminal 1 continues to be the industry's easiest X terminal
to install. Just type one command and answer one yes/no question and install
the terminal software effortlessly in just minutes.  No other X terminal can
claim the superior administration, installation, and performance of
SPARC Xterminal 1.

<UL>
<LI>

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</H2>
<H3>
Q. Will AnswerBook(R) be supported on the SPARC Xterminal 1?
</H3>

<P>
<B>A.</B> Yes, the X-based AnswerBook available with Solaris 2.3 will operate with
   X Terminal Software Version 2.1.  Older, NeWS-based versions of AnswerBook
   will not.
</P>

<H3>
Q. What are the boot host requirements?
</H3>

<P>
<B>A.</B> Any SPARCstation, SPARCserver(TM) or SPARCcenter(TM) system with
   Solaris 1.1 or later Solaris 1.x release or Solaris 2.1 or later
   Solaris 2.x release is required from which the X-terminals can boot and
   be administered. The servers must be present after terminal booting to
   provide the SPARCstation X-terminal 1 with additional X terminal utility
   services.
</P>

<H3>
Q. Since the SPARC Xterminal 1 now supports BootP, does this mean I
   can boot from non-Sun servers?
</H3>

<P>
<B>A.</B> No.  Sun's market focus of the SPARC Xterminal 1 and X Terminal
   Software Version 2.1 is on SPARC/Solaris environments.
   Public domain BootP daemons are available for operation on the
   SPARC/Solaris server.
</P>

<H3>
Q. Do current SPARCclassic X customers need to upgrade their software
   to Version 2.1?
</H3>

<P>
<B>A.</B> No. The software features and functionality in Version 2.1 are
   identical to Version 2.0, with the exception for the new
   SPARC Xterminal 1 hardware platform support.
</P>

<H3>
Q. Will customers be able to upgrade from the SPARC Xterminal 1
   to a SPARCstation 4?
</H3>

<P>
<B>A.</B> Yes, Sun has a component upgrade available to a SPARCstation 4.
</P>

<H3>
Q. Why does the SPARC Xterminal 1 only support 128 MB maximum memory,
   while the SPARCstation 4 supports up to 160 MB?
</H3>

<P>
<B>A.</B> SPARCstation 4 provides a total of five expansion memory slots. SPARC
   Xterminal 1 supports four memory expansion slots, more than enough memory
   for X terminal applications.
