The thin tower with the clock is the
<i><a href="http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=115458">Metropolitan
Life Building</a></i> (not to be confused with the <i>MetLife Building</i>)
next to the <i><a href="http://www.madisonsquarepark.org/">Madison Square
Park</a></i>.  Behind the black box, is a building that looks kind of like
it had it top chopped off.  That's the
<i><a href="http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=115331">Metropolitan
Life North Building</a></i>, which was originally intended to dwarf the
previously mentioned building.  In front of the black box is
<i><a href="http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=115516">New York
Life Building</a></i>.
